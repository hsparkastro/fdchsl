<!-- Dr. Hwang's research has been strongly motivated by difficult and interesting practical problems such as controlling multiple-vehicle systems. Controlling multiple-vehicle systems is one of the most important and challenging aspects of modern system theory and practice. Control of such
systems involves the analysis of multiple dynamical systems which have inherently decentralized structures. The motions of vehicles have to be
coordinated in such a way that the vehicles achieve their goals without conflicts between them. This requires path planning (computing optimal
trajectories of vehicles from starting positions to destinations) and conflict detection and resolution. Path planning and conflict detection and
resolution require information about individual vehicles, and therefore communication between vehicles for sharing this information is important. Multiple-vehicle systems encompass a variety of applications, including groups of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Satellites, and mobile robots; ad-hoc sensor networks; air traffic control. -->
