The research in the FD&C/HS Lab [(Lab Director: Professor Inseok Hwang)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ihwang/) focuses on two directions: **fundamental research on Intelligent and High Assurance autonomy for the Cyber-Physical System (CPS)**, which is a complex (networked) system with interacting physical and logical components, using hybrid systems theory, and its **applications to safety-critical aerospace systems** such as aircraft, spacecraft, Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), and Air Traffic Control (ATC), and multiple-vehicle systems (e.g., swarm of UAS). Note that aerospace systems are good examples of the CPS. For example, a UAS (similarly, aircraft and spacecraft) is composed of an autopilot which is a logical element and a vehicle that is a physical element, thus it is a CPS.

<!--- Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

 Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. --->
