1. Journals are articles, conference papers are inproceedings.
Theses are either phdthesis or msthesis.

2. Journals need title, author, journal, volume, number, pages, year
Conference papers need title, author, booktitle, year, month, location
Theses need title, author, year, month

3. Capitalize paper titles per APA style: https://capitalizemytitle.com/style/APA/

4. Use doi and arxiv (just the identification, not the full link!)

5. For accolades (ex. best paper award, invited, finalist) use annote
For other notes (ex. submitted on ..., under review, accepted on ...) use note
